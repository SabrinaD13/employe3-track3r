User Story: 
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business.

Description:
In this module, we were supposed to create a databse that keeps track of multiple different types of information regarding a company, it's branches, employee, managers and salaries. Using MYSQL12 and Inquirer, I was able to create an MVP application that fullfills most of this functionality.
